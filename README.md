Nodewol
=======

Nodewol is a simple wake-on-lan tool written with node, underscore, backbone, RaphaÃ«l, jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap. It is intended for the low-power Raspberry Pi.

At the moment the (web-based) UI is optimized for desktop/laptop use. A fully responsive mobile UI is in progress. And yes, the clock widget is a shameless ripoff from the exquisite Nokia N9.

## Installation

Required packages are nodejs, npm, g++ and libpcap-dev (the latter two for dependencies). It is recommended to install nbtscan as well for NetBIOS name resolution and subnet scanning. Nodewol supports reverse DNS as well.

On Debian Raspbian "wheezy", the recommended installation procedure is:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install nodejs npm nbtscan g++ libpcap-dev
npm install nodewol
</pre>

On other Debian installations you may have to edit your /etc/apt/sources.list. Instructions for that [here](http://ypcs.fi/howto/2012/10/09/nodejs-debian/). On other distributions you should find a way to install node, npm and nbtscan and the rest can be done with npm.

## Configuration

Check config.js.

## Usage

Currently Nodewol requires root privileges because of the packet capturing feature (which automatically adds devices to the list). In the Nodewol directory, do a "sudo node app.js".

## Known issues

* The packet capturing feature slows networking down somewhat.
* Multiple devices may appear to have the same IP in a network with many dynamic leases.
* The clock widget may behave a little odd occasionally.
* If the browser window is too narrow the panels overlap.
* Only IPv4 networks are supported.
* There's no way to add a device manually.
* The code is poorly documented.
