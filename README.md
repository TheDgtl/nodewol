Nodewol
=======

Nodewol is a simple wake-on-lan tool written with node, underscore, backbone, RaphaÃ«l, jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap. It is intended for the low-power Raspberry Pi.

At the moment the (web-based) UI is optimized for desktop/laptop use. A fully responsive mobile UI is in progress.

## Installation

Required packages are node and npm. It is recommended to install nbtscan as well for NetBIOS name resolution and subnet scanning. Nodewol supports reverse DNS as well.

On a Debian box (such as the Raspbian edition), the recommended installation procedure is:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install node npm nbtscan
npm install nodewol
</pre>

## Configuration

Check config.js.

## Usage

Currently Nodewol requires root privileges because of the packet capturing feature (which automatically adds devices to the list). In the Nodewol directory, do a "sudo node app.js".

## Known issues

* The packet capturing feature slows networking down somewhat.
* Multiple devices may appear to have the same IP in a network with many dynamic leases.
* The clock widget may behave a little odd occasionally.
* If the browser window is too narrow the panels overlap.
* Only IPv4 networks are supported.
* There's no way to add a device manually.
